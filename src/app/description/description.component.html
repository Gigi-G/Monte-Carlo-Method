<p>The Monte Carlo Method is a numerical method based on probabilistic procedures, used in statistics for the resolution of problems of various kinds, 
which present analytical difficulties or are difficult to overcome.</p>
<p>The Monte Carlo method can be used to determine the surface of a lake.<br>
Let us be given a rectangular or square area of which we know the length of the sides. Within this area there is a lake 
whose surface is unknown. Thanks to the measurements of the sides of the zone, the area of the rectangle is known.<br><br>
To determine the area of the lake, X dots are randomly generated on this area. We then count the number N of dots that have remained on the earth and 
we can now determine the number of dots that are inside the lake, that are X-N.</p><br>
